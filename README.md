# Sales-and-Performance-Analysis-Data-Warehouse-Project-SSIS-SSAS-SSRS-
Sales and Performance Analysis ‚Äî Data Warehouse Project (SSIS | SSAS | SSRS) 

üìÅ Project Overview
This project showcases a complete end-to-end Data Warehousing Solution, starting from a normalized transactional database and culminating in business insights delivered through SSRS reports. It integrates core components of the Microsoft BI Stack including SSIS (ETL), SSAS (Cubes), and SSRS (Reporting).

The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful KPIs that support business decision-making and performance analysis.

üîÑ Project Workflow


1. Transactional Database (Source)
The project begins with a normalized database representing the operational side of the business.

    * Highly normalized structure

    * Inefficient for reporting

    * Source for ETL

2. Data Warehouse Design
Data is reorganized using a Star Schema to optimize for reporting and analysis.

    * act Tables: Central tables with business metrics

    * Dimension Tables: Lookup tables for descriptive context
 
  FactSales

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DimDate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DimRegion

3. ETL Process with SSIS
SSIS is used to build and schedule the data pipeline.

    * Extracts data from the transactional DB

    * Applies necessary transformations (e.g., type casting, cleaning)

    * Loads data into the data warehouse

Key components:

  * Data Flow Tasks

  * Lookup & Derived Columns

  * Slowly Changing Dimensions

üß† Why Are SCDs Important?
Without SCDs, if a customer moves to a new region or a product changes category, your data warehouse would overwrite the old value, losing the history. SCDs help preserve those changes to maintain data accuracy over time, which is critical for accurate trend analysis, auditing, and business insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Types of Slowly Changing Dimensions

üîπ Type 0 ‚Äì Fixed Dimension
    * No changes are allowed.
    * The data remains as it was at the time of the initial load.
    * Used when attributes must remain historically accurate and unaltered

üîπ Type 1 ‚Äî Overwrite (No History)
    * The old data is replaced with the new data.
    * Used when history is not important.

üîπ Type 2 ‚Äî Add New Row (Preserve History)
    * A new record is added with a new surrogate key.
    * Keeps full history of changes.
    * Often includes: StartDate, `

üîπ Type 3 ‚Äì Add New Column (Limited History)
    * Adds a new column to store the previous value.
    * Only keeps limited history (usually one prior state).



4. Building OLAP Cubes with SSAS
    * SSAS enables multidimensional analysis and enhances performance with pre-aggregated data.
    * Designed cubes with measures and dimensions
    * Enabled slicing/dicing, drill-down, and roll-up
    * Created KPIs for dashboards

5. Visualizing with SSRS
    * Finally, SSRS was used to build professional, paginated reports.
    * Interactive dashboards
    * Parameterized reports
    * Export options (Excel, PDF, Word)
